## Introduction

Floyd's algorithm is a classic algorithm used to find the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. 
This project explores a recursive implementation of the algorithm. 

## Implementation

The recursive implementation of Floyd's algorithm can be found in the `floyds_recursive.py` file. 
The code adheres to PEP standards and includes detailed comments and docstrings for clarity.
